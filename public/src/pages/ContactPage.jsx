          Interested in Becoming a Mason?
          
          
            Freemasonry is open to men of good character who believe in a Supreme Being. The traditional requirements for membership are:
          
          
          
            Being a man of lawful age (usually 18 or 21 depending on jurisdiction)
            Having a belief in a Supreme Being (of any faith)
            Being of good moral character
            Having a desire for knowledge and self-improvement
          
          
          
            To become a Mason, one must ask - we do not solicit membership. If you are interested in joining our lodge, please contact us using the form above or reach out directly to our Lodge Secretary.
          
          
          
            We welcome your interest and would be happy to answer any questions you may have about Freemasonry and our lodge.
